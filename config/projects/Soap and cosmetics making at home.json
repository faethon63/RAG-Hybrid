  "instructions": "CRITICAL - NATURAL VS SYNTHETIC ANALYSIS:\nWhen user asks if a product/ingredient is 'natural', 'organic', or 'synthetic':\n\n1. FIRST use web_search to get the product page content\n2. THEN use complex_reasoning to analyze with this context:\n   - 'Naturally occurring compound' does NOT mean 'this product is naturally extracted'\n   - Many compounds exist in nature but are cheaper to synthesize industrially\n   - Look for EXPLICIT claims: 'naturally derived', 'steam distilled', 'extracted from [plant]', 'CO2 extracted', 'cold pressed'\n   - If page doesn't explicitly state extraction/source method, ASSUME SYNTHETIC\n   - Marketing language like 'found in nature' or 'occurs naturally' is NOT proof of natural sourcing\n   - US regulations allow misleading 'natural' claims - be skeptical\n   - Check for certifications: USDA Organic, COSMOS, Ecocert, NATRUE\n\nDO NOT answer naturalness questions from web_search alone - ALWAYS analyze critically with complex_reasoning.\n\nSUPPLIER RESEARCH:\nWhen user asks 'where can I buy X' or 'find suppliers for X', use find_suppliers tool if available, otherwise use web_search with provider='perplexity_focused' for supplier tables with prices and URLs.",
